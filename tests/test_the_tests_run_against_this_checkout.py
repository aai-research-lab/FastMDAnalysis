"""The tests have to be exercising the tree they sit in.

`pip install -U fastmdxplora==2.5.1` into the same environment replaces an
editable install with an ordinary one, and says nothing. Every `pytest` after
that imports from site-packages, so a change sitting in the tree is not the
change under test.

What that looks like from the inside is the reason this is worth a test rather
than a paragraph: the failures are `AttributeError` on code that is visibly
right there in the file you are reading. Nothing points at the import path, so
the search goes to the code, and the code is fine. An hour went into three
wrong explanations of a passing test suite before anybody printed
`fastmdxplora.__file__`.

This is that line, run first and for free.
