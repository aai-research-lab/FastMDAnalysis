"""Every subcommand's --help must format, and the schema must stay readable.

argparse expands help strings with `%`, so a literal percent becomes a format
spec: `71% of a cube` in box_shape read as a `% o` octal conversion and raised
at print_help() time while the parser still built fine. Shipped broken in
2.5.1 through 2.5.4.

The obvious fix -- doubling the percent in the schema -- is wrong, because
config/generate.py and gui/schema_payload.py print the same text verbatim and
would show `71%%`. The escaping belongs at the argparse boundary, so both
halves are asserted here.
