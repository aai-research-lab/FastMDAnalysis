RMSD and RMSF align on `name CA` by default. Alanine dipeptide has one CA, so
MDTraj's C extension printed "UNCONVERGED ROTATION MATRIX. RETURNING IDENTITY"
once per frame -- a window's log filled with thousands of lines of it -- and
returned distances measured against no alignment at all. Those are not large
errors; they are a column of numbers that looks like results.

Reported as inapplicable rather than attempted, the way a chain too short to
