"""AUD7: no free energy in the package carried an uncertainty.

`statistics.py` gives an honest standard error for the mean of a per-frame
number, and refuses where the series is too short to measure its own
correlation time. A free energy is not the mean of anything -- WHAM solves
over every window at once, a metadynamics surface is a sum over hills, a
reweighted average divides by a partition function estimated from the same
samples -- so none of them could be handed to it, and none of them carried
a bar. `reweighted_std` moved 3% for a 37-fold drop in effective sample
size while the report printed it as a plus-or-minus.

The tests below check the two things that make a bootstrap honest rather
than merely present: that the width is right when the answer is known, and
that a series too short to measure its own correlation time is told so
instead of being given a tight bar.
