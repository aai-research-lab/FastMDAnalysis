"""A run's Overview leads with what it needs, says Not determined quietly,
and puts the means beside the run on a wide window.

The Overview of a run that ended opened on a grid of tiles, each with an
orange "Not determined" badge (17 of 19 on a short run), the reason only on
hover, and how much longer the run would need only in the fix card further
down; all of it in one column of 845 px between empty margins. It now leads
with one sentence: how many means are determined and, where some are not,
how much more production the analyses asked for and what that takes at this
run's own speed, said as not known where the records do not give it. A tile
says Not determined in the muted colour, with its reason in a line; and
where the page's column is 1180 px wide or more the means and the run sit
side by side (the column's width, not the window's: the side panel open
beside it leaves too little for two).
