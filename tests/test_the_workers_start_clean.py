"""Parallel workers start clean, and a test that hangs is named, not waited on.

Three CI runs in a row walled silently at the first parallel batch test --
the streamed log ends at the last scheduling test, because pytest writes a
test's name without a newline until it finishes, so the hanging test is the
one you cannot see. Each wall was a six-hour squat on a runner until a job
timeout existed, and together they wore the disguise of "tremendous CI
delays". The walls began the day OpenMM landed in CI, which is the day the
parallel tests started doing real work in worker processes.

The mechanism: ProcessPoolExecutor without an mp_context forks on Linux,
and a forked worker inherits the parent as it stood -- including thread
pools that numpy, mdtraj and OpenMM had started over the preceding four
hundred tests, whose threads do not survive the fork but whose locks do.
It never reproduced on the one-core machine used to develop the fix,
because on one core those pools are never spun up and the parent is
thread-free at fork time. macOS and Windows spawn and never hung.

So: spawn everywhere, pinned here; and a per-test timeout in the suite's
own configuration, so the next wall -- whatever causes it -- fails as a
named test with every thread's stack attached instead of hanging a runner.
