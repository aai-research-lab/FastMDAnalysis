"""A look gives the analysis asked about first, and a reason said once.

A look gives the AI model 4,000 characters. The record of a short run, each
analysis not determined saying the same rule at length, was cut in the
RMSD entry of the 1L2Y study the `context` run was asked against, and the
analyses after it never reached the Agent (version 2's Results). Now a
reason gives its own first sentence on its analysis's line and the rest
once under the list, and `read_study` gives the analysis asked about first:
named with `analysis`, by the Report's section or the
file open in the reader, or by an analysis named with @. The analysis
asked about keeps its reasons whole, and notes are numbered from the rows
shown only.
