"""Parallel runs divide the machine rather than fight over it.

OpenMM's CPU platform takes every core it can see, and a pool of workers each
doing that oversubscribes by the worker count. Six runs on eight cores is six
times the threads the machine has, and the study finishes slower than three
would have -- so `workers` could not be used well on CPU at all, which is an
odd state for a setting the software offers.
