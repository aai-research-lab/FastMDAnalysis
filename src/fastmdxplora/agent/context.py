"""What the Agent is told about where the person is and what was said.

Three parts of a message, each given only where there is something in it,
and each pointing at a record rather than standing in for one:

- **What is named with @** (``@rmsd``, ``@study``, ``@frame 120``,
  ``@Trp6``, ``@docs``, ``@file analysis/rg/options.json``, a study's
  folder by its name): each resolved here, by the software, to what it
  names and the look that reads it. Nothing is pasted in: an analysis is
  named with its record, never with its numbers, and a name that matches
  nothing is said to match nothing, so it is asked about rather than
  guessed.
- **The turns before the last few**, kept as what was decided and what is
  still open, each line with the turn it came from. They were kept by
  their first sentence, so "Thanks, that helps. Use CHARMM36m." lost the
  force field twenty turns later. The person's own words are kept whole
  (they are short and they decide); a config the Agent wrote is kept as the
  settings it set or changed; a question as asked, and as still open where
  nothing after it answered it.
- **The plan** the Agent keeps across turns, as the person's checklist
  shows it, so the twentieth turn still knows which step comes next.

None of it is a fact the AI model may quote. It says where to look; the
looks say what is so.
